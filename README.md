# Nexus
Welcome to Nexus â€“ a practice web application designed to mimic the gaming discovery experience of RAWG.io. This project is built with Vite and styled using Chakra UI.


## Introduction
Nexus is a personal project aimed at replicating the core features and design of RAWG.io, a comprehensive video game discovery platform. It leverages the RAWG.io API to fetch game data and provides a user-friendly interface built with Vite and Chakra UI. This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for commercial use.
